		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			A make-ahead basmati side dish with mild coconut flavors.
		</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3 onions</li>
			<li>1 tablespoons sunflower oil</li>
			<li>1 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1kg bag basmati rice</li>
			<li>2 x 400ml cans coconut milk</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Peel and finely chop the onions</li>
			<li>In a big saucepan or casserole with a lid, gently soften the onions in the oil and butter</li>
			<li>When really soft, add the rice and cook, stirring, for a couple of mins.</li>
			<li>
				Tip in the coconut milk with 2 cans of water. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring, then cover, lower the heat to the lowest setting and cook for 10-15 mins.<br>
				<i>(Scraping the bottom regularly with a wooden spoon to stop it sticking)</i> 
			</li>
			<li>
				Check the rice: it should be sticky and creamy but not watery, and not quite cooked â€“ still a bit crunchy. Tip into a big bowl that will fit in a microwave and cover with cling film.<br>
				<i>(Chill until ready to serve, for up to a day.)</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				To serve, poke a hole in the cling film and microwave for 8 mins on High, stirring halfway, until piping hot and cooked through. Add some salt and stir with a fork to break up the grains.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This recipe is flour-based. It is generally served as an aperitif at various receptions in Africa.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Vegetable oil</li>
			<li>2 cups flour (500g)</li>
			<li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>1 cup butter</li>
			<li>2 milk tablespoons(optional)</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons ground nutmeg</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Combine the flour and sugar in a large bowl and add the ground nutmeg to the flour.
			</li>
			<li>
				Rub the butter over the flour mixture until it mixes well and becomes smooth.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make a hollow in the flour and break the eggs into it, add the milk and mix well with your hands, until you get a dough that is not too sticky.<br>
				<i>(If your dough sticks too much to your hands, add a little more flour.)</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				Roll out the dough on a cutting board, then use a knife to cut the dough into small squares.<br>
				<i>(You can shape the croquettes as you wish (squares, rectangles, circles, etc...)</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat the vegetable oil until very hot and fry the small croquettes, stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking together.<br>
				<i>(When your patties are nicely golden or light brown, remove them from the heat and place them on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.)</i><br>
				Let cool and serve.
			</li>
		</ol>
